This project contains a small program used to perform a stress test of a web
application to ensure that it's performing as expected.

The basic execution process is to read an input file with a test URL on each
line, and then simulate heavy traffic using those requests.  The project is
written in Python (with a small Bash helper) and requires Python 2.7+ to run.

To get going, get an input file named "input.txt" ready, and run
    ./stresstest.sh
